#' FIFA22 players dataset
#'
#' A dataset containing information about the players in FIFA 22.
#' 
#' The dataset includes many of the players in FIFA 22 for the Career Mode.

#' player names, the columns hold the variables.

#' or the value of a player, as a function of a bunch of variables from 
#' the dataset. Of course, note that these values all come from the 
#' FIFA22 game, so they may or may not accurately depict real life 
#' scores.
#' 
#' The variables have very clear names that speak for themselves. There 
#' are 19145 players in the dataset, with 48 variables.
